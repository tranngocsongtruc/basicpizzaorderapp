# basicpizzaorderapp
In this project, we will be writing a pizza ordering program. It creates a pizza ordered to the specifications that the user desires by selecting the size, crust, and toppings. After submitting their order, the customer will be provided with a receipt that includes their order and cost (including tax at a rate of 0.0875).

Project Two: Pizza Order Application

-------------------------

Objectives:

● variables and assignments

● simple flow of control (if and if ... else statements)

● functions

● GUI (graphical User Interface) components using the built-in module
Tkinter

In this project, we will be writing a pizza ordering program. It creates a pizza
ordered to the specifications that the user desires by selecting the size, crust, and
toppings. After submitting their order, the customer will be provided with a receipt
that includes their order and cost (including tax at a rate of 0.0875).
The user will choose from the following specifications:

● Pizza size: small priced at 10.99, medium priced at 12.99, and large
priced at 14.99.

● Crust: implemented with radio buttons, thin-crust, Deep-dish, or hand-
tossed.

● Toppings: this feature uses check boxes allowing the user to choose as
many toppings as desired from the list of Pepperoni, sausage,
mushrooms, and onions. The default topping is cheese. The cost of
each extra topping is $1.25.

Important Note about images:
The images that are best compatible with Tkinter are GIF. One strategy is to design your full
image in in any tool (I used Word) then take a snapshot of it and paste it into Paint. Save your
image as GIF.

Remember your image file must be inside the same folder as your python file.

Test Cases:
Tax rate for all cases is 0.0875. You can use your own names to represent the owners of the pizzeria.
