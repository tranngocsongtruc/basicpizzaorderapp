# basicpizzaorderapp
In this project, we will be writing a pizza ordering program. It creates a pizza ordered to the specifications that the user desires by selecting the size, crust, and toppings. After submitting their order, the customer will be provided with a receipt that includes their order and cost (including tax at a rate of 0.0875).
